## Pods
#
# CocoaPods
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
#
# Pods/

## Swift Package Manager
#
# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in source code from Swift Package Manager dependencies.
# Packages/
# Package.pins
# Package.resolved
# *.xcodeproj
#
# Xcode automatically generates this directory with a .gitkeep file to keep it under SCM. This has
# caused confusion for newcomers. Therefore, the file is not committed directly, but instead a
# marker is created to remind that Packages/ exists.
