# Onboarding and Paywall Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive onboarding and paywall system for the Party Games iOS app, including premium content gating and StoreKit subscription integration.

## Requirements Analysis
- **Onboarding**: Single page showcasing app features with continue button
- **Paywall**: Display weekly ($3.99) and lifetime ($19.99) subscription plans
- **Premium Content**: Mark 5 games as premium with gold crown indicators
- **Theme Consistency**: Match existing dark theme with teal accents (#1EE3D2)
- **Architecture**: Maintain MVVM pattern using SwiftData and SwiftUI

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models
1. **UserPreferences Model**
   - Track onboarding completion status
   - Store premium subscription state
   - Use @AppStorage for simple flags, SwiftData for complex state

2. **Enhanced GameCategory Model**  
   - Add `isPremium: Bool` flag
   - Mark 5 categories as premium: "Truth or Dare", "Would You Rather", "Never Have I Ever", "How Well Do You Know Me", "This or That"
   - Keep 5 categories free for user experience

3. **StoreKitManager Service**
   - Handle product loading and purchases
   - Validate subscription receipts
   - Support both recurring (weekly) and non-renewing (lifetime) subscriptions

### UI Components

#### OnboardingView
- Black background matching GameSessionView theme  
- App icon (partygamesicon.png) prominently displayed
- Feature showcase: "10 Game Categories", "Hundreds of Cards", "Swipe to Play"
- Teal accent continue button using existing button styling
- Single page design with smooth animations

#### PaywallView
- Dark theme with teal accent colors
- Two subscription cards with card-style design:
  - Weekly Plan: "$3.99/week" with "3-day free trial" badge
  - Lifetime Plan: "$19.99 once" with "Best Value" highlight
- Restore purchases option
- Close/dismiss functionality

#### Category UI Enhancements
- Gold crown icon overlay (`crown.fill`) for premium categories
- Premium category tap shows paywall instead of game session
- Maintain existing CategoryCardView design patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (30 minutes)
1. Create `Models/UserPreferences.swift` with @AppStorage integration
2. Add `isPremium` flag to GameCategory model
3. Create `Services/StoreKitManager.swift` with basic product loading
4. Update SwiftData schema to handle model changes

### Phase 2: Core Views (45 minutes)  
1. Build `Views/Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift`
   - Feature showcase layout
   - App icon integration  
   - Theme-consistent styling
2. Build `Views/Paywall/PaywallView.swift`
   - Subscription card designs
   - Purchase flow integration
   - Error handling

### Phase 3: Integration (30 minutes)
1. Update `ContentView.swift` navigation flow:
   - Show onboarding for new users
   - Present paywall after onboarding
   - Handle premium status checks
2. Modify `CategorySelectionView.swift`:
   - Add premium crown indicators
   - Intercept premium category navigation
   - Present paywall for premium access
3. Update data initialization to set premium flags

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (15 minutes)
1. Test complete user flow: onboarding → paywall → categories
2. Verify premium category access control
3. Test subscription purchase and restoration
4. Handle basic error states and edge cases

## Success Criteria
- ✅ New users see onboarding → paywall → category selection flow
- ✅ Premium categories display gold crown and trigger paywall
- ✅ StoreKit purchase flow works in test environment
- ✅ Premium status persists across app launches  
- ✅ Free categories remain accessible without subscription
- ✅ Existing user data and sessions preserved

## Risk Mitigation
- Use existing app patterns for UI consistency
- Implement graceful fallbacks for StoreKit failures
- Cache premium status to avoid repeated API calls
- Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data

## File Changes Required
- **New Files**: UserPreferences.swift, StoreKitManager.swift, OnboardingView.swift, PaywallView.swift
- **Modified Files**: GameCategory.swift, ContentView.swift, CategorySelectionView.swift, Party_GamesApp.swift
- **Assets**: Utilize existing app icon and theme colors

## Testing Strategy
- StoreKit sandbox testing for purchase flows
- UI testing across different device sizes
- Verify onboarding shows only once
- Test premium access after purchase
- Validate subscription status edge cases

This plan maintains MVP principles while delivering comprehensive onboarding and paywall functionality that integrates seamlessly with the existing Party Games app architecture.
